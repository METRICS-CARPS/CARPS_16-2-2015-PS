#### Methods summary: 

The authors attempted to replicate previous findings that conception risk is related to women's racial bias. Specifically, previous research had found that women who had a higher likelihood of becoming pregnant given the day in their menstrual cycle exhibited stronger racial biases favoring White men over Black men on a variety of measures. The authors of the present study attempted to replicate this in a high-powered design. In Study 1 (which we attempt to reproduce in this report), 867 women were recruited. Participants' current menstrual cycle day was used to estimate conception-risk. Participants' explicit racial biases (explicit racial preference, explicit warmth towards Whites, explicit warmth towards Blacks) were estimated from self-report measures and implicit racial bias were estimated from Implicit Association Tests. Correlations with 95% confidence intervals were reported between conception risk and the explicit and implicit bias measures.

------

#### Target outcomes: 

We will attempt to reproduce all findings related to Study 1 in the quoted text:

> For all racial measures, higher scores represented pro-White bias. The mean score for implicit racial bias was 0.34 (SD = 0.43) in Study 1, 0.33 (SD = 0.42) in Study 2, 0.27 (SD = 0.41) in Study 3, and 0.18 (SD = 0.37) in Study 4. The mean score for explicit racial bias was 0.30 (SD = 1.09) in Study 1, 0.30 (SD = 1.05) in Study 2, 0.27 (SD = 0.83) in Study 3, and 0.53 (SD = 1.05) in Study 4. Mean rated warmth toward European Americans was 7.18 (SD = 2.07) in Study 1 and 7.15 (SD = 2.00) in Study 2, and mean rated warmth toward African Americans was 6.69 (SD = 2.06) in Study 1 and 6.78 (SD = 2.12) in Study 2. The mean score for explicit physicality stereotypes was 0.80 (SD = 0.83) in Study 3 and 0.81 (SD = 0.85) in Study 4, and the mean score for implicit physicality stereotypes was 0.26 (SD = 0.36) in Study 3 and 0.21 (SD = 0.38) in Study 4. As in Navarrete et al. (2009), we created composite bias scores in each study by standardizing and then averaging all racial-bias measures (warmth toward African Americans was subtracted from warmth toward European Americans to create a warmth difference score prior to standardizing). Mean conception risk was 0.03 (SD = 0.03) in Study 1, 0.03 (SD = 0.03) in Study 2, 0.04 (SD = 0.03) in Study 3, and 0.03 (SD = 0.03) in Study 4. Correlations were computed between conception risk and each race variable, including the composite score. To best match the existing literature, we computed correlations for White women only (see the Supplemental Material for additional analyses). Conception risk did not significantly correlate with any of the individual measures of racial bias (see Table S4 in the Supplemental Material) or with the composite score in Study 1, r = .00, 95% confidence interval (CI) = [−.09, .08]; Study 2, r = .00, 95% CI = [−.09, .08]; Study 3, r = .03, 95% CI = [−.17, .22]; or Study 4, r = .05, 95% CI = [−.11, .21].

>...we excluded women who: (a) reported contraceptive use, that they were currently pregnant or uncertain of current pregnancy status, as well as women whose current cycle was day 41 or higher or had a previous cycle of irregular length - less than 20 days or more than 40 days; or (b) women who reported infertility due to menopause or some other health reason, or if they reported that they were uncertain of reproductive status, preferred not to say, or they left the reproductive question blank. After these exclusions, Study 1 contained 867 women and Study 2 contained 878 women with a valid conception risk score. (Supplementary Materials for Hawkins, Fitzgerald, & Nosek (2014) p. 1)

# Step 5: Conclusion

We found several discrepencies between values reported in the text and our obtained values. The authors included a table of correlations with 95% confidence intervals between the different dependent measures (available in Supplemental Materials). We noted several major errors in correlation coefficients (r values) and confidence intervals. It is not clear to us what the source of the discrepency is, although it could be that different software packages (the authors used SAS and we are using R) give different values for these tests. None of the errors amount to decision errors or change the conclusions. 

All descriptive statistics reported in the paper matched our obtained values.

```{r}
Author_Assistance = FALSE # was author assistance provided? (if so, enter TRUE)

Insufficient_Information_Errors <- 0 # how many discrete insufficient information issues did you encounter?

# Assess the causal locus (discrete reproducibility issues) of any reproducibility errors. Note that there doesn't necessarily have to be a one-to-one correspondance between discrete reproducibility issues and reproducibility errors. For example, it could be that the original article neglects to mention that a Greenhouse-Geisser correct was applied to ANOVA outcomes. This might result in multiple reproducibility errors, but there is a single causal locus (discrete reproducibility issue).

locus_typo <- NA # how many discrete issues did you encounter that related to typographical errors?
locus_specification <- NA # how many discrete issues did you encounter that related to incomplete, incorrect, or unclear specification of the original analyses?

locus_data <- NA # how many discrete issues did you encounter that related to errors in the data files shared by the authors?
locus_unidentified <- NA # how many discrete issues were there for which you could not identify the cause

Affects_Conclusion <- NA # Do any reproducibility issues encounter appear to affect the conclusions made in the original article? TRUE, FALSE, or NA. This is a subjective judgement, but you should taking into account multiple factors, such as the presence/absence of decision errors, the number of target outcomes that could not be reproduced, the type of outcomes that could or could not be reproduced, the difference in magnitude of effect sizes, and the predictions of the specific hypothesis under scrutiny.
